--- Day 6: A Villain Rises... ---

All is merry in Santa's Village, the standard mass-produced Elf Advent Calendar had a big chocolate today and the mood is **electric**. That is, until reports start flying
in by MerryMail from Santa's outposts across the world that they've been receiving strange messages from a mysterious sender.

They seem to be very small cut-up fragments of a larger postcard. A note, sent directly to Santa himself, reads:

> Dear Santa,
>
> You've grown complacent. Grown sloppy. Sat watching the snowflakes, sipping your cocoa, you are BLIND to the world around you.
> It's time to wake up. And I HATE Christmas music.
>
> I've descended on a city with a name you'd recognise, and I'm bringing eternal frost and a bitter cold with me!
>
> Good luck finding me -- I've cut up my postcard into hundreds of pieces!
>
> Cold regards,
> The Grinch.

This note is widely regarded to be a total vibe killer. The elves are terrified, and look to you for help...

---

There are **256** fragments of the postcard, that need to be stitched together in a 16x16 grid to reconstruct the original image.

Once you've stitched together the image, you can get the answer by performing the following:

\`\`\`
pngtopnm image.png > image.pnm
md5sum image.pnm
\`\`\`

The answer will be the outputted hex bytes.

*Hint 1: the sample code is a good starting point.*
*Hint 2: \`chunk_964560701.png\` is the bottom-right chunk of the final image.*
*Hint 3: don't overcomplicate this, edge comparison is easier than you think!*
