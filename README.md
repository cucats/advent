# CUCaTS Advent of Code 2024

This is a spinoff of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), a popular challenge where participants solve 25 pairs of problems in December.
[Our version](https://aoc.cucats.org) had 19 problems in 2024.

## Building

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install --force
```

Then get the .env file from anyone who has it, and run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.
